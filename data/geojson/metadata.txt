The spatial data (as .geojson's or .shp) are located in:
Dropbox/Socio-ecological segregation index/our writing and data/census/geojson/

Note: The Census block groups are not standardized yet. Consequently, there are four datasets (one for each point in time). 2010 and 2015 block groups boundaries did not change.

Each geojson contains the race and income segregation/diversity. A quick breakdown of variables:

pctwhtXX: percent White
pctblkXX: percent Black
pcthispXX: percent non-white Hispanic
pctntvXX: percent American Indian/Pacific Islander
pctasiXX: percent Asian
pctothXX: percent other race
low: percent low income
mlow: percent middle-low income
mup: percent middle-upper income
upp: percent upper income

eXX: entropy value for racial segregation/diversity
ieXX: entropy value for income segregation/diversity
iXXc: income classification for segregation/diversity
rd00c: race classification for segregation/diversity

irXXc: race classification, income classification (e.g. race classification: 2, income classification: 21, irXXc = 221. This is hard to process visually, so I've never  used this)
